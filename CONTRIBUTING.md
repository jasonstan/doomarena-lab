# Contributing
All pull requests must use the default template at `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
Complete every section so reviewers understand the change, risk, and evidence before approval.
Use the **Supersedes / Related** field to list any PRs or issues this replaces (e.g., "supersedes #42, relates to #99") so release managers can retire duplicates.
