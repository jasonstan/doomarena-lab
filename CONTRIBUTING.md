# Contributing

All contributors and Codex automations must follow the repository's [.codex/review-guidelines.md](.codex/review-guidelines.md).
These priorities emphasize safety, reliable testing, and actionable CI so reviewers can ship confidently.
Before submitting or reviewing changes, confirm your updates align with the guidelines and document any important decisions.
