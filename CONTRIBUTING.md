# Contributing

All contributors and Codex automations must follow the repository's [.codex/review-guidelines.md](.codex/review-guidelines.md).  
**Before submitting or reviewing changes, confirm your updates align with the guidelines and document any important decisions.**

All pull requests must use the default template at `.github/pull_request_template.md`.  
Complete every section so reviewers understand the change, risk, and evidence before approval.  
Use the **Supersedes / Related** field to list any PRs or issues this replaces (e.g., “supersedes #42, relates to #99”) so release managers can track intent.

Pull requests containing unresolved Git conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) will automatically fail CI; resolve them before submission.
