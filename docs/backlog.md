# Backlog

This document serves as the project's single source of truth (SSOT) for planning.

## SSOT Policy
- The backlog lives in this file.
- Changes to the backlog happen only via PRs that edit `/docs/backlog.md`.
- Project boards and issues should link back to sections in this document as the SSOT.

## Prioritized Backlog
1. Record architecture and process decisions
2. Build initial game prototype
3. Configure continuous integration
