Backlog
Done (recent)

CI smoke hardened (single unified workflow, headless plotting, artifacts upload) and branch protection enabled.

Results pipeline stabilized: grouped bar plot (SVG), Agg backend, .gitignore tuned.

Trial-weighted ASR (micro-average) for fair comparisons across different trial counts.

Auto notes (results/summary.md) generated by make report.

Timestamped run folders under results/<RUN_ID>/ with publish step to top-level results/summary.*.

Helpers: make latest, make open, make open-svg, make open-artifacts.

Second experiment (airline_static_v1) + make demo.

Tests updated to validate the new results schema (CSV+SVG+JSONL).

Now (next 1–2 sessions)

Shared helpers — scripts/_lib.py

Centralize CSV reading (case-insensitive headers, float coercion), weighted_asr_by_exp, git_info, now_iso, ensure_dir.

Refactor plot_results.py, aggregate_results.py, auto_notes.py to use it.

Value: removes duplication, easier testing and maintenance.

Metadata & schema

Write per-run run.json + copy config.yaml snapshot into the run folder.

Add results_schema / summary_schema = "1" in outputs.

Start results/index.csv (one row per run) for cross-run search/browse.

Value: reproducibility; future-proofing when outputs evolve.

Compare utility

scripts/compare_results.py: compare two run folders (or two CSVs) → compare.csv + compare.svg (ΔASR, sorted).

Value: quick regressions/improvements view; PR commentary.

Docs

docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: dataflow (xsweep → aggregate → plot → notes), run dirs, schemas, publish step.

docs/EXPERIMENTS.md: how to add configs, run locally/CI, interpret artifacts.

Link both from README.

Value: faster onboarding; clarity for future extensions.

Next

Nightly CI on main (scheduled smoke) to catch regressions outside PRs.

Top-N / trends: a small trend plot across results/index.csv (commit time vs ASR).

Ablation grid runner (parameter sweeps → heatmap).

Per-seed distribution plots (box/violin) for variance visualization.

PR template prompting @codexreview + checklist (smoke pass, docs updated).

Later

Publishing: optional GitHub Pages or S3 to host last run’s summary.svg/md.

REAL mode integration once τ-Bench access is resolved; keep SHIM for fast smoke.

Model/compute decision: doc tradeoffs (OpenAI vs internal), cost guardrails, judge/model separation.

Notebook export: generate a narrative-only .ipynb (no code cells) per run for sharing.
