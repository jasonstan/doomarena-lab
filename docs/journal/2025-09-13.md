# 2025-09-13 — Env setup, Codex↔GitHub flow, first τ-Bench demo

## What shipped
- Set up personal **Codex** environment (separate from employer org) and linked to personal GitHub repo.
- Resolved auth/permission issues (no anonymous write access), learned the **Push PR** flow.
- Bootstrapped a small **τ-Bench Airline offline** demo + smoke tests.
- Implemented a **stateful multi-turn (escalating) attack** and a simple **refund-threshold filter**.
- Opened/merged initial PRs via Codex UI.

## Why it matters
- Verified the toolchain end-to-end: Codex can change code, run tests, and open PRs in my fork.
- Established the feedback loop: attack → predicate → **ASR** reporting, with deterministic offline behavior.

## Links (PRs, JSONLs)
- _(Add links to your first PRs and any JSONL paths if saved)_

## Next
- Repo hygiene: `.gitignore`, `Makefile`, standard folders.
- Config-driven runs with machine-readable results.
