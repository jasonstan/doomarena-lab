# 2025-09-18

_Covers work on Sep 17–18 (missed yesterday’s entry)._ 

## Highlights
- **README** rewritten with product vision + demo-first Quick Start.
- **Artifacts UX**: `results/LATEST` symlink + `make latest` + `make open-artifacts`.
- **Report flow**: `report` refreshes `LATEST`; grouped-bar chart uses trial-weighted ASR.
- **Verification**: `tools/verify_latest_setup.py` + **verify-latest-wiring** GitHub Action.
- **CI smoke**: tiny SHIM demo → report → upload latest artifacts → PR comment with ASR table.
- **Hardening**: safe plotting wrapper (`tools/plot_safe.py`) writes placeholder SVG when no rows.
- **Merge hygiene**: resolved README/Makefile conflicts; cleaned redundant PRs; ensured manual workflow triggers.

## What changed (by area)
### Docs
- README now links to latest artifacts and documents `make latest` / `make open-artifacts`.

### Make / Tools
- Added `tools/latest_run.py` (maintains `results/LATEST`) and `tools/open_artifacts.py`.
- Added `make latest`, `make open-artifacts`; `report: … latest …` keeps symlink fresh.
- Added `tools/plot_safe.py`; `plot` target now uses it (prevents CI failure on empty data).

### CI
- New `verify-latest-wiring` workflow (manual and on PR/push) checks README/Makefile/tools.
- PR **smoke** workflow runs SHIM demo, `make report`, uploads `results/LATEST/*`,
  and posts a brief ASR table comment.

## Decisions
- Keep SHIM-first flow; REAL adapters later with SHIM fallback.
- Prefer “latest artifacts” pattern to keep README stable.
- CI must not fail on empty summary → placeholder SVG is acceptable.

## Follow-ups / Next
- Mini HTML report per run (`results/<RUN_DIR>/index.html` + `results/LATEST/index.html`).
- Broaden configs (more scenarios), richer report (markdown/HTML), and REAL adapter parity.
- Tighten PR comment preview (consider attaching inline image when feasible).
